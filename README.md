# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP--Cpp

Introduction:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm that focuses on creating and modeling real-world entities as objects. These objects have attributes (data members) and behaviors (member functions) and are organized into classes. This repository contains various C++ code examples that illustrate OOP concepts and demonstrate how to implement them in practice.

Classes and Objects:

. Definition and implementation of classes.

. Creation of objects and member variables.

. Access specifiers (private and public) to control member accessibility.


Constructors and Destructors:

. Default constructor and parameterized constructor.

. Copy constructor for object initialization.

. Destructor to release memory resources.


Operator Overloading:

. Overloading arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform operations on custom objects.

. Overloading comparison operators (>, ==) to compare objects.

. Overloading prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators (++ and --) for custom behavior.


Friend Functions:

. Use of friend functions to allow non-member functions access to private members of a class.


Encapsulation:

. Encapsulation of data and behavior within class methods.

. Data hiding and encapsulation of member variables using private access specifiers.


Member Functions:

. Definition and implementation of member functions to perform operations on objects.


Dynamic Memory Allocation:

. Usage of dynamic memory allocation (new/delete) to manage objects' memory.


Input/Output Operator Overloading:

. Overloading input and output stream operators (<< and >>) to enable custom input and output operations.


Conversion Functions:

. Creating conversion functions to convert Roman numerals to decimal numbers and vice versa.


Conditional Statements and Loops:

. Use of conditional statements (if-else) to perform specific actions based on conditions.

. Use of loops (for, while) to iterate over strings and arrays.


C++ Standard Library:

. Utilization of standard library functions (e.g., strcpy, strlen, strcmp) for string manipulation.

. Usage of standard library containers (e.g., string, ostream, istream) and algorithms.
